# 0x01 - Graphs

This is the second project of the Algorithms section of the Low Level Systems, Algorithms, and Blockchain curriculum.

## What we did ğŸ¤”

In this project, we:
* learned about the [graph data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28abstract_data_type%29)
* built a set of functions that construct and manipulate graphs.


### The Breakdown:


| File | Purpose | Usage |
|-|-|-|
| [./0-graph_create.c](./0-graph_create.c) | Defines `graph_t *graph_create(void);`, a function that initializes a new graph data structure | `make 0` |
| [./1-graph_add_vertex.c](./1-graph_add_vertex.c) | Adds a vertex to an existing graph. | `make 1` |
| [./2-graph_add_edge.c](./2-graph_add_edge.c) | Adds an edge to an existing graph. | `make 2` |
| [./3-graph_delete.c](./3-graph_delete.c) | Deletes an entire graph | `make 3` |
| [./4-depth_first_traverse.c](./4-depth_first_traverse.c) | Traverses a graph using a "depth-first" algorithm | `make 4` |
| [./5-breadth_first_traverse.c](./5-breadth_first_traverse.c) | Traverses a graph using a "breadth-first" algorithm | `make 5` |
